### Purpose of Thyself Inc.

Thyself Inc. was founded by Zulfikar Moinuddin Ahmed after a decade of work on S4 Physics,
a new fundamental physics theory that overthrows a century of incoherent fundamental physics. It is a macroscopic physics that replaces two fundamental forces that have been theorized in the past three centuries, electromagnetism and gravity into a single force
called S4 Electromagnetism. It is also based on scientific breakthroughs in personality psychology including discovery of more than 1024 types of personality types extending Briggs-Myers types in data.

### Application areas are Personalization of Goods and Services and Molecular Dynamics

The current order of software technology while making tremendous advances in engineering
of systems and artificial intelligence cannot provide true personalization without
a deep hierarchy of personality types that we can pioneer based on our empiricial results
dated October 2019.

### S4 Physics-based Molecular Dynamics

Molecular Dynamics today based on Newton approximations are established with such simulation software such as CHARMM and GROMACS. This approach leads quickly to computational loads that require supercomputers. S4 Physics promises to reduce the
computational burden so that 10 microsecond simulations can be done with Spark on EC2.

### About Zulfikar Moinuddin Ahmed

Zulfikar Moinuddin Ahmed graduated magna cum laude Mathematics AB from Princeton University in 1995, and was in the Ph.D. program of Columbia University with position at MIT before 2000. He has worked in the Lehman Brothers Fixed Income Derivative Research team of Andy Morton in 1995, was the Vice President of Quantitative Research at Gresham Investment Management in 2007, has worked at technology startups Ecosystems Inc. of Robert Reich in 1998 and Babel Research in 2007-8. At the moment he is focused on development of
Thyself Inc.

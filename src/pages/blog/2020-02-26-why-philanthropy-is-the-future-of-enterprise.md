Philantrhopy is not about giving away money to charity.  It is simply love of humanity.  In the long evolution of some millions of years, in our evolution from earlier primates and more recently in the past seven thousand years of history of civilization, it has taken us a long time to realize our unity.  But only the internet age has produced a situation where we face instant connectivity of the entire human race.  It is now that with good, bad, and ugly of humanity we must face our collective future together.  It is now that businesses and enterprises exist to serve the entire human race, and to make life better and our collective civilization better.  

 While we have accepted in the past rough industrialists enjoying privileges without explicit philanthropy in the core values, this will not be viable in the long run and philanthopic orientation becomes the natural outlook of future enterprises.  

In some industries, philanthropy has been considered a matter of secondary importance or even more radically simply a matter of public relationship management; this cynical outlook, while quite entertaining in Hollywood drama is not appropriate for future serious enterprises. Great enterprises of the future must take seriously philanthropy as a raison-d'etre for the enterprise in the first place.  In this viewpoint, we exist to serve the purpose of providing services and goods that improve the human condition and profit is a secondary concern.  There is no separation between the two facets of business.  Rather than thinking about the orientation in terms of customer service enterprises will have to be reborn as fundamentally oriented towards human service.
